# `stevenwa.sh`: Gatsby Powered Personal Blog site

## Why?

Because I literally can't stop myself from redoing my site over and over

## What are you using?

* Gatsby (with the starter blog without styles)
* styled-components
* Probably some other stuff but my brain is friend right now

## What are you going for?

Weird material-y design, minimalist and modular.

## What about pagination?

I don't have enough content to need to paginate just yet. We'll cross that bridge when we get there.

## The content's dumb!

_You're_ dumb. j/k ilu.

## What?

I know right, stupid millenials and their _chat-speak_.
