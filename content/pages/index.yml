about_title: Hello! I make kick-butt websites.
about_content: >-
  My goal is to make the web better and better neat interactive thingies, games,
  stories, etc. I work on this on my own as well as a part of the <a

  On the web side, I'm currently diving deep into React, plumbing the depths of
  what can be done with the library! Also React is a gateway drug to sweet
  modern Javascript. I'm also playing around with game development using Unity,
  Game Maker, and Twine.
