Over the last few weeks I have sat down to write an article or two about projects I've been working on, and mostly ideas, concepts, and snippets that I have learned in the meantime, to share with all of you. While writing these articles, I've come across a single thread that prevents me from fully publishing them:

## They're all wrong.

Now, they aren't all wrong from top to bottom. These are all based off of my own projects, after all, and they work, right? But in several cases, while compiling my learnings and writing them down, I start looking at the issue from a new perspective, separated from "making it work" and realize that perhaps my approach was wrong. In some cases, isolating the concept from the system it sat in didn't work, and simplifying surrounding code made the situation I was working with irrelevant. But the surrounding code was too beefy to explain around without losing sight of the point of the article.

## It's okay to be wrong.

I don't want to dissuade anyone from posting anything, worrying "what if I'm wrong?" That's part of the learning process after all! I believe the mandate of posting articles or advice is to convey information to the best of your ability, and as correct as you know you can. This means that it's okay if you post something, find out it's wrong, and go back to fix it! That means you're learning! It's okay if someone cames by and offers a correction or submits a PR. Pobody's nerfect, after all.

However, I have a hard time putting out content that I know is wrong. Content that, even though I am using those concepts in my personal projects, and they _technically_ work, any advice coming from my Github repository would have to come with a heavy dose of "do as I say, not as I do."

## No time wasted

On the heels of writing up articles, creating CodeSandbox examples, and generally pouring a lot of work into these pieces and projects that won't see the light of day, it's easy to think that I just spent a lot of time and effort for nothing. I incorporated this concept into a project, spent time and resources writing about it, only for it to be wrong and I have to re-do everything? It's really easy to get frustrated and turn away and never look back.
