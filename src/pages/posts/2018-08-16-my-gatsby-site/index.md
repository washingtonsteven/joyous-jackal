My [personal site](https://stevenwa.sh) is currently powered by GatsbyJS (and Markdown!) I had a few ideas for the site that I implemented myself on top of Gatsby's engine, and I'd like to tell you about some of the customizations I did!

## Custom Post Types

Yes, by day I'm mainly a Wordpress developer. The idea of custom post types is very common over there, and I immediately had an idea for that on my personal site: a 'posts' type, which would house normal blog posts, and a 'projects' type which would house info on projects I'm working on, which could be easily cobbled together into a sort of portfolio.
