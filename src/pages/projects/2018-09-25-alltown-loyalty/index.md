Alltown Advantage is a React App built as part of the greater <a href="https://alltown.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://alltown.com</a> site. The app connected to a third party API that held all the necessary data for the loyalty programs, and the web application allowed for retrieval of data (points earned, transaction history, rewards earned), as well as editing of personal information (address, phone, password). 

The application also tied into the main site by reading certain content from the Wordpress database, in order to keep the entire site experience cohesive.

This app was built along with the team at <a href="https://connellypartners.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connelly Partners</a>
